The report titled "Bluetooth-Controlled Soccer Robot" details the development of a soccer-playing robot created by Team Arduinox-4 for the Summer 2023 Techfest at Independent University, Bangladesh. The project involves a multi-agent system integrating robotics, sensor fusion, intelligent control, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, designed to track and interact with a soccer ball.

Key highlights of the project include:
- Hardware: The robot uses components like BTS 7960 motor drivers, 300 RPM motors, a 2200mAh battery, and a B3 charger. The robotâ€™s movement and ball control are managed by a custom Arduino code.
- Methodology: The design process followed phases like brainstorming, rapid prototyping, and systematic testing, ensuring functionality and performance.
- Performance: The robot demonstrated impressive results, achieving an 85% success rate in ball interception and a 75% goal conversion rate at Techfest.
- Challenges: Issues like decision-making latency and intermittent Bluetooth connectivity were encountered. Future improvements involve exploring better communication methods and motion planning algorithms.

The project aims to improve human-robot collaboration in sports and has potential future applications in robotics research, healthcare, and entertainment.
